If I said I didn't love the well-known internet celebrity, [Grumpy Cat](http://www.quickmeme.com/Grumpy-Cat/), then I would be lying. She is maybe the grumpiest-looking cat on the planet, but I suspect that she's actually a happy kitty trapped in a grumpy shell. She's an adorable enigma, so I decided to paint her.

I started with a photo of her and a small canvas panel, drew a grid of four, and then sketched her. Here's the initial sketch:

Then, I did an underpainting. An underpainting is a haphazard-ish blobbing of colors that approximate the final colors of each part of the painting.

I've been experimenting with modeling pastes and textured gels. There are all kinds of pastes and gels that you can mix in with acrylics. Some turn acrylic paint into almost-clay that will maintain the texture of the original brush strokes, some slow down the drying time (which makes the acrylics more blendable and similar in appearance to oil paint), some create a highly shiny appearance, and some add strange textures (sandy, crackly, etc.). I used modeling paste to try and maintain some of the brushstrokes used in the fur, and I used a sandy-textured medium on the snout. I applied these using a palette knife right onto the painting without first mixing them with color, which I suspect is not the proper way to use them. (But it is definitely more blobby, gooey, and fun that way.)

Looks like she's getting a facial. Next, I added color in to these gels.

Grumpy Cat is pretty strange looking so far. Things started coming together a little bit when I put details into the fur using a smaller-diameter brush. I also put dark purple in the areas of deep shadow (see her mouth, her nostrils, and the fur fringing her snout). An art teacher long ago instilled in me to never, ever use black, but to instead create blacks by mixing complementary colors (purple+yellow, for example). I find that a dark purple usually does the job.

Then, the fun part -- the eyes! The little white reflections of light in the eyes wrap it up.

Voila! Grumpy Cat documented in acrylics for posterity. Perhaps the best thing about this painting is that it can be used as a mask when I need to convey certain grumpy emotions.
