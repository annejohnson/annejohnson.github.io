    <h2>Painting With Feathers</h2>
    <h5 class="meta">January 1, 2014</h5>

    <p>I recently did a painting of my maximilian pionus parrot, Edwin. He&#39;s sweet, wonderful, brilliant, and (conveniently) fond of molting.</p>

<p>A recent trip to Asheville, NC, and its <a href="http://www.riverartsdistrict.com/">River Arts District</a> inspired me to create this painting. While there, I met an amazing artist who incorporates dried plant material and other found objects into her paintings. After seeing her work, I decided to play with using found objects... certain feathery found objects that magically appear all over my apartment!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been saving Edwin&#39;s beautiful dropped feathers since my trip to Asheville. Come Christmas-time, I had accumulated a stash large enough to experiment with them in paintings. I began this feathery adventure with a photo of Edwin:</p>

<p>After cropping the image into a portrait composition, I drew Edwin onto a canvas panel.</p>

<p>Then, I did an underpainting involving lots of modeling paste (which would later act as glue for the feathers).</p>

<p>Next, I added in whites on the upper part of Edwin&#39;s head, where he has light gray downy feathers. I also added in dark purple (which acts as black/shadow-color) into Edwin&#39;s chest area and began working on his beak.</p>

<p>A few steps get blended together in the image below. I put some feathers into the modeling paste/paint and painted over them with dark purples. Then, I added in feathery texture to the face and neck using U-shaped blobs of dark purple and light green.</p>

<p>Finally, I added more feathers, finished his beak, and did his eye!</p>
