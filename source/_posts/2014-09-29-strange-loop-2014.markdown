I went to a tech conference called <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/" target="_blank">Strange Loop</a> last week. It takes place once a year in Saint Louis, Missouri, and features talks by the creators and earliest users of cutting-edge technologies. I've heard that the technologies you learn about at Strange Loop are those that people will be using widely in a couple of years. Strange Loop is a way to explore this exciting future.

This was my very first tech conference, and I had an **amazing** time! I overloaded my brain with talks about new and mind-bending technologies, and I met more brilliant people than I can count.

## Highlights

I could go on and on for a very long time about all that I enjoyed at Strange Loop. I'll try to confine everything within a few bullet points.

- <a href="http://www.manning.com/poweredbyjavascript/" target="_blank">**Powered by Javascript**</a>: a pre-conference event all about Javascript. Some talks covered new+upcoming features in Javascript. Others were about Javascript reaching into new realms of development. Some of my favorite talks were:
  - **Virtual Reality in JavaScript** by <a href="https://github.com/dmarcos" target="_blank">Diego Marcos</a>. Javascript meets the <a href="http://www.oculus.com/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a>!
  - **Closures and Currying in JavaScript** by <a href="https://twitter.com/gneatgeek" target="_blank">Rory Hardy</a>. Finally those frigging things make more sense.
  - **Build mobile apps with Javascript using the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic Framework</a>** by <a href="https://twitter.com/gnomeontherun" target="_blank">Jeremy Wilken</a>. Javascript as a tool for creating native-quality mobile apps.
- <a href="http://www.citymuseum.org/" target="_blank">**The City Museum!**</a> Strange Loop rented out the entirety of Saint Louis's quirkiest attraction for a night. I had a great time climbing around in the museum's otherworldly structures with fellow Strange Loop attendees.
- **Amazing Strange Loop talks.** A short list of those that were most inspiring to me:
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKaHkkpdHxg" target="_blank">**Nashorn: implementing a dynamic language runtime on the JVM**</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/asz" target="_blank">Attila Szegedi</a>. He talked about the process of getting a dynamically typed language to compile into JVM bytecode. My favorite phrase from the talk is definitely **Unwarranted Optimism Exception**.
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJpb1j2SWfA" target="_blank">**Art.js: Transfigure Data to Create 21st Century Art**</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/supersgp" target="_blank">Sarah Groff-Palermo</a>. She inspired me to think more creatively about data - that it can be used not just to make highly structured presentations, but also art - and all in code.
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAwbjMdXj-Y" target="_blank">**DOMStep: Audio Synthesis, AI and a JavaScript Dance Party**</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jergason" target="_blank">Jamison Dance</a>. Extremely entertaining talk, and who knew that browsers have an audio API? Well, I didn't... 
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xbrMTieJa0" target="_blank">**Democratizing Hardware**</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod" target="_blank">Chris Williams</a>. As a result of this talk, I've added "small NodeBot project" to my list of To-Do's.
  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IQlpFWTFbM" target="_blank">**You can be a kernel hacker!**</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk" target="_blank">Julia Evans</a>. Hilarious and informative, all at once! Offered great advice for learning how to dig deeper into Linux OS code.
- **The Strange Loop Keynotes**. Joe Armstrong talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4" target="_blank">"the mess we're in"</a>: how we've gotten ourselves into a trench of bloated code and complexity, and how computers have more possible states than the number of atoms in gajillions of universes. Nada Amin talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A" target="_blank">venturing into "meta-levels"</a> with a reflective programming language called Black. Stephen Wolfram talked about the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjCWdsrVcBM" target="_blank">Wolfram programming language</a>. And, to wrap it up, a group of speakers delivered the final keynote as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zW63dcZB0" target="_blank">robot dance party</a>. Catchy music and dancing hardware, all powered by Clojure.

## Diversity Scholarship
I attended Strange Loop with the help of a diversity scholarship. Many very generous individuals and companies contributed to the scholarship pool - and enabled Strange Loop to dramatically increase the percent of minority attendees. 

#### To those generous people:
**THANK YOU!** This experience meant so much to me! Not just for all that I learned, but also for the rare opportunity to see diversity in technology. And, rarer still, for the opportunity to see people from diverse backgrounds **giving talks** and **being leaders** in the industry. I feel revitalized and inspired. I can't wait to pay this experience forward.
