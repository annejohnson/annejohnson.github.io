I recently did a painting of my maximilian pionus parrot, Edwin. He's sweet, wonderful, brilliant, and (conveniently) fond of molting.

A recent trip to Asheville, NC, and its [River Arts District](http://www.riverartsdistrict.com/) inspired me to create this painting. While there, I met an amazing artist who incorporates dried plant material and other found objects into her paintings. After seeing her work, I decided to play with using found objects... certain feathery found objects that magically appear all over my apartment!

I've been saving Edwin's beautiful dropped feathers since my trip to Asheville. Come Christmas-time, I had accumulated a stash large enough to experiment with them in paintings. I began this feathery adventure with a photo of Edwin:

After cropping the image into a portrait composition, I drew Edwin onto a canvas panel.

Then, I did an underpainting involving lots of modeling paste (which would later act as glue for the feathers).

Next, I added in whites on the upper part of Edwin's head, where he has light gray downy feathers. I also added in dark purple (which acts as black/shadow-color) into Edwin's chest area and began working on his beak.

A few steps get blended together in the image below. I put some feathers into the modeling paste/paint and painted over them with dark purples. Then, I added in feathery texture to the face and neck using U-shaped blobs of dark purple and light green.

Finally, I added more feathers, finished his beak, and did his eye!
