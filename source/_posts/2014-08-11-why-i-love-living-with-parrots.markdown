Strange and wonderful things happen when you adopt parrots!

I have 2 parrots, Edwin and Petrie. I adopted Edwin in August, 2013, followed by Petrie in November. Last Tuesday marked one year of birdhood for me, and it has been delightful!

Here are some of the awesome things I've found about having parrots:

<img src="/images/blog/parrots/edwin.jpg" alt="Edwin" class="alignleft" />**1. Parrots are challenging, but dedication pays off.**<br />When I first brought Edwin home, he didn't want ANYTHING to do with me. I had anticipated this because it's typical behavior for a rehomed adult bird, but it was still disconcerting. Nevertheless, I closely followed the advice of being friendly but distant, slowly gaining his trust. After a few days, he accepted food from me, and after a week, he stepped up on my arm. After a month or two, he let me scratch his neck. After several months, he started saying "I love you!" Our relationship continues to grow each day.

**2. Parrots can be the most loving creatures on earth.**<br />Petrie came to me at the tender age of 7 months, na√Øve, clipped, and with broken stumpy tail feathers. He was trusting from the start, but not loving - though this has changed. Over time, Petrie became more and more affectionate. Nowadays, he's either sitting on my laptop when I'm surfing the internet, bobbing his head when I talk to him, or flying to me when I leave the room. I'm honored to have won his affections!

Parrots encourage healthy eating.**<br />It's already rewarding to eat healthy fruits and vegetables, but it becomes doubly rewarding when I'm able to share these foods with my 2 dearests. Not to mention that it's really fun to discover new foods that they like. A few months ago, I discovered that Petrie _loves_ blueberries.

And since parrots are naturally vegetarians, I can buy food for them that is neither sketchy nor smelly (I'm talking about you, dogfood and catfood).

**4. Parrots are great to talk to.**<br />It feels a little less like I'm talking to myself with these guys than it would with other pets. Sometimes Edwin and Petrie even talk back. We've definitely had conversations before, usually consisting of: "Hello." "Hello." "Hello!" "Hello." \*whistle\* \*whistle\* ...ad infinitum. Simple as our conversations might be, they are more special than many conversations I've had with actual people.

**5. Parrots encourage a healthy sleep schedule.**<br />Birds wake up at sunrise and go to bed at sunset. 10 hours of sleep is the recommended amount for pet parrots. Dimming the lights for Edwin and Petrie at a reasonable hour helps me, too, go to bed at a reasonable hour. Also, birds help me be a better morning person. Actually.. they force me to be! Thanks to the Petriebird alarm clock, we never waste a day.

**6. Parrots live for a long time.**<br />Edwin's and Petrie's life spans are both estimated to be 30-40 years (for some species, this number is lower, and for many species, much higher). Edwin is only 6, and Petrie is only 1, so we will hopefully have many more years together.

**7. Parrots are smart, and they love learning!**<br />Edwin and Petrie pick up new phrases and sounds easily. They are also very easy to train. Edwin learned how to wave on command in just a couple days. Sometimes they learn things even when I'm not consciously training them... for example, Edwin learned how to go into his cage anytime I say "Go in here!"

I've had many kinds of pets - cats, dogs, hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas, rats, fish, geckoes... I love them all, but parrots definitely top the list!
